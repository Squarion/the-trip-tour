                    <h1>Panama City</h1>
                    <p>
                        The city was founded on August 15, 1519, by Pedro Arias de Ávila, also known as Pedrarias Dávila. Within a few years of its founding, the city became a launching point for the exploration and conquest of Peru and a transit point for gold and silver headed back to Spain through the Isthmus. In 1671 Henry Morgan with a band of 1400 men attacked and looted the city, which was subsequently destroyed by fire. The ruins of the old city still remain and are a popular tourist attraction known as Panamá la Vieja (Old Panama). It was rebuilt in 1673 in a new location approximately 5 miles (8 km) southwest of the original city. This location is now known as the Casco Viejo (Old Quarter) of the city.

                    <p>
                        The Isthmus of Panama was formed about 3 million years ago when the land bridge between North and South America finally closed, after which plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions. The existence of the isthmus had an impact on the dispersal of people, agriculture and technology throughout the American continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities.

                    <h1>Buzludzha</h1>
                    <p>
                        Buzludzha (Bulgarian: Бузлуджа Buzluđa derived from Turkish icy) is a historical peak in the Central Balkan Mountains, Bulgaria and is 1441 metres high (4728 ft). In 1868 it was the place of the final battle between Bulgarian rebels led by Hadji Dimitar and Stefan Karadzha[1] and the Ottoman Empire.

                        The Buzludzha Monument on the peak was built by the Bulgarian communist regime to commemorate the events in 1891 when the socialists led by Dimitar Blagoev assembled secretly in the area to form an organised socialist movement with the founding of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party, a fore-runner of the Bulgarian Communist Party. The Monument was opened in 1981.[2] No longer maintained by the Bulgarian government, it has fallen into disuse.

                        The monument was built at a cost of 14,186,000 leva.[3][citation needed][context?]

                        Buzludzha can be reached by two side roads from the Shipka Pass:[4] either a 16 km (10 mi) road from Kazanlak or a 12 km (7 mi) road coming north from Gabrovo.

                        Now the monument is abandoned and vandalised. As the roof of the building is heavily damaged, the main entrance of the building has been closed to the public.
